;;; Commentary:

;; Description

;; req-package is a macro wrapper on top of use-package.
;; It's goal is to simplify package dependencies management,
;; when using use-package for your .emacs.

;; Usage

;; 1) Load req-package:

;;    (require 'req-package)

;; 2) Define required packages with dependencies using :require like this:

;;    (req-package dired)
;;    (req-package dired-single
;;                 :require dired
;;                 :init (...))
;;    (req-package lua-mode
;;                 :init (...))
;;    (req-package flymake)
;;    (req-package flymake-lua
;;                 :require (flymake lua-mode)
;;                 :init (...))

;; 3) To start loading packages in right order:

;;    (req-package-finish)

;; Migrate from use-package

;;    Just replace all (use-package ...) with (req-package [:require DEPS] ...)
;;    and add (req-package-finish) at the end of your configuration file.

;; Note

;;    All use-package parameters are supported, see use-package manual for additional info.

;;    Also there are possible troubles with :defer keyword provided by use-package.
;;    If you want to use it, try :defer all packages in one dependency tree.

;; Changelog:

;;    v0.4-all-cycles:
;;       All cycles of your dependencies will be printed.
;;       Also there are more handy log messages and some bug fixes.
;;    v0.3-cycles:
;;       There are nice error messages about cycled dependencies now.
;;       Cycles printed in a way: pkg1 -> [pkg2 -> ...] pkg1.
;;       It means there is a cycle around pkg1.
;;    v0.2-auto-fetch:
;;       There is no need of explicit :ensure in your code now.
;;       When you req-package it adds :ensure if package is available in your repos.
;;       Also package deps :ensure'd automatically too.
;;       Just write (req-package pkg1 :require pkg2) and all you need will be installed.
