;;; Commentary:

;; Description

;; req-package is a macro wrapper on top of use-package.
;; It's goal is to simplify package dependencies management
;; when using use-package for your .emacs.

;; Usage

;; 1) load req-package:

;;    (require 'req-package)

;; 2) define required packages with dependencies using :require like this:

;;    (req-package dired)
;;    (req-package dired-single
;;                 :require dired
;;                 :init (...))
;;    (req-package lua-mode
;;                 :init (...))
;;    (req-package flymake)
;;    (req-package flymake-lua
;;                 :require (flymake lua-mode)
;;                 :init (...))

;; 3) to start loading packages in right order:

;;    (req-package-finish)

;; Migrate from use-package

;; Just replace all (use-package ...) with (req-package [:require DEPS] ...)
;; and add (req-package-finish) at the end of your configuration file.

;; Note

;; All use-package parameters are supported, see use-package manual for additional info.

;; Also there are possible troubles with deferred loading provided by use-package.
;; If you want to use it, try defer all packages in one dependency tree.
