;;; Commentary:

;; req-package is a macro wrapper on top of use-package
;; it's goal is to simplify package dependencies management
;; when using use-package for your .emacs

;; usage:

;; 1) (require 'req-package)
;; 2) define required packages with dependencies using :require like this:
;;      (req-package dired
;;      (req-package dired-single
;;                   :require dired
;;                   :init (...))
;;      (req-package lua-mode
;;                   :init (...))
;;      (req-package flymake)
;;      (req-package flymake-lua
;;                   :require (flymake lua-mode)
;;                   :init (...))
;; 3) (req-package-finish) to start loading packages in right order

;; note:

;; all use-package parameters are supported, see use-package manuals
;; for additional info.

;; there are possible troubles with deferred loading provided by use-package.
;; if you want to use it, try defer all packages in one dependency tree.
