;;; Commentary:

;; Description

;; req-package is a macro wrapper on top of use-package.
;; It's goal is to simplify package dependencies management,
;; when using use-package for your .emacs.

;; Usage

;; 1) Load req-package:

;;    (require 'req-package)

;; 2) Define required packages with dependencies using :require like this:

;;    (req-package dired) ;; you can omit this empty requirement because of dired-single

;;    (req-package dired-single
;;      :require dired
;;      :config (...))

;;    (req-package lua-mode
;;      :config (...))

;;    (req-package flymake)

;;    (req-package flymake-lua
;;      :require (flymake lua-mode)
;;      :config (...))

;; 3) To start loading packages in right order:

;;    (req-package-finish)

;; After calling req-package-finish targets list is cleaned and
;; you can start requiring and loading a new bunch of packages.
;; It may be useful when you need to load some package after all.

;; Note req-package expects :require keyword strongly after package name.

;; Do not write something like this:

;;    (req-package foo :ensure bar :require baz) ;; WRONG

;; It won't work. The right code will be:

;;    (req-package foo :require baz :ensure bar) ;; RIGHT

;; Migrate from use-package

;;    Just replace all (use-package ...) with (req-package [:require DEPS] ...)
;;    and add (req-package-finish) at the end of your configuration file.

;; Note

;;    All use-package parameters are supported, see use-package manual for additional info.

;; Changelog:

;;    v0.4.2:
;;       Bug fixes.
;;    v0.4.1:
;;       Various tweaks and bug fixes.
;;    v0.4-all-cycles:
;;       All cycles of your dependencies will be printed.
;;       Also there are more handy log messages and some bug fixes.
;;    v0.3-cycles:
;;       There are nice error messages about cycled dependencies now.
;;       Cycles printed in a way: pkg1 -> [pkg2 -> ...] pkg1.
;;       It means there is a cycle around pkg1.
;;    v0.2-auto-fetch:
;;       There is no need of explicit :ensure in your code now.
;;       When you req-package it adds :ensure if package is available in your repos.
;;       Also package deps :ensure'd automatically too.
;;       Just write (req-package pkg1 :require pkg2) and all you need will be installed.
